# The Music Theory Hub

### Author: Daniel Gaviria

## Description

This is a project that longs to be the music theory hub that amateurs and professionals alike could use. This idea will be updated on an ongoing basis where I intend to add interactivity for a better learning experience for children and adults that want to deepen their understanding of music theory and/or brush up on concepts that were long forgotten. This idea is at the inception stage so what you see right now could change in the next week.

I have not deployed this application but I intend to do it when it reaches a mature stage worthy of the attention of the public. If you would like to run this application in your local machine you could *clone* it and run `npm install`. 

## Technologies used

This application wants to grow to be a full stack application. For the time being I am using the following technologies:

+ NodeJS
+ Express
+ Web Audio API, Web Animations API, Web Midi API
+ Vanilla Javascript, CSS, HTML

I will be deciding which technologies/frameworks to use as this application grows but I intend to use *MongoDB* as the database and perhaps *Bootstrap* to enhace the looks and feel of the frontend.
